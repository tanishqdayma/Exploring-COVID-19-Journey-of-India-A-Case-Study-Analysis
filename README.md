# Exploring-COVID-19-Journey-of-India-A-Case-Study-Analysis
Exploring India's COVID-19 journey with hands-on data analysis, including dataset cleansing, analysis, and insight extraction using Python and SQL.

The project was completed within the Hicounselor program (https://hicounselor.com/) to apply data analysis and sentiment analysis skills to a real-world problem. The dataset was provided by Hicounselor.

This project aims to gain insights into the distribution of COVID-19 cases by age group, confirmed cases, recoveries, and daily reductions in India. Furthermore, explore state-level information encompassing case data, mortality rates, recoveries, hospital bed availability, testing statistics, and population distribution. Through delving into these datasets, this project aspires to foster a holistic grasp of India's COVID-19 scenario, empowering informed choices and strategic responses in tackling the pandemic.

Used Technologies:

Python: The programming language for data manipulation and analysis.

Pandas: A powerful tool for data manipulation and transformation.

Jupyter Notebook: The interactive canvas for code, insights, and findings.
